Bugs:


tasks:

- configure prod mode to the firebase db - due on july, 10th
- add landing page
- publish
- buy domain and link it
- calculate a general estimation of the group
- review layout in general
  - hide "admin" things?
  - estimator after "admin" things
- test in mobile devices
- add share link
- refactor: 
  - extract to another layer all the references to firebase
  - find better ways to define the domain objects
- automated testing
- pipeline

nice to have /Evaluate:
- load the current estimator if a session was found on the window
- there is a flick/flickering on change of information e.g. when an estimation is ready
