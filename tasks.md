- change layout to horizontal instead of vertical
  - the sliders? or everything?
- calculate a general estimation of the group
- review layout in general
  - hide "admin" things?
  - estimator after "admin" things
- test in mobile devices
- add share link
- refactor: 
  - extract to another layer all the references to firebase
  - find better ways to define the domain objects
